        <center><h1><b>Color Theory for Designers,<br>Part 1: The Meaning of Color</b></h1></center>
            <div style="margin-left: 17em; margin-right: 17em; font: 13pt NanumSquareOTF; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: left;">
            <p>There are few things in design that are more subjective—or more important—than the use of color.<br>A color that can evoke one reaction in one person may evoke the opposite reaction in another, due to culture,<br>prior association, or even just personal preference.<br>[Content update: February 2021]</p>
            <p>Color theory is a science and art unto itself, which some build entire careers on, as color consultants or sometimes brand consultants. Knowing the effects color has on a majority of people is an incredibly valuable expertise that designers can master and offer to their clients.</p>

            <p>There’s a lot to it, though. Something as simple as changing the exact hue or saturation of a color can evoke a completely different feeling. Cultural differences can compound those effects, with a hue that’s happy and uplifting in one country becoming depressing in another.</p>
            <p><b>Warm Colors</b></p>
            <center><img src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5991c72d-73b7-4321-b1f1-dbd2daf21d03/warmcolors.jpg"></center>
            <p>Warm colors include red, orange, and yellow, and variations of those three colors. These are the colors of fire, of fall leaves, and of sunsets and sunrises, and are generally energizing, passionate, and positive.<br>Red and yellow are both primary colors, with orange falling in the middle (making it a secondary color), which means warm colors are all truly warm and aren’t created by combining a warm color with a cool color. Use warm colors in your designs to reflect passion, happiness, enthusiasm, and energy.</p>
            <p><b>Cool Colors></b></p>
            <center><img src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0b1cd991-b205-477a-9c4e-4e446bad1159/coolcolors.jpg"></center>
            <p>Cool colors include green, blue, and purple, are often more subdued than warm colors. They are the colors of night, of water, of nature, and are usually calming, relaxing, and somewhat reserved.<br>Blue is the only primary color within the cool spectrum, which means the other colors are created by combining blue with a warm color (yellow for green and red for purple).<br>Because of this, green takes on some of the attributes of yellow, and purple takes on some of the attributes of red. Use cool colors in your designs to give a sense of calm or professionalism.</p>
            <p><b>Natural</b></p>
            <center><img src="https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ba39b178-c9b2-4331-bd25-1a31b717817f/neutralcolors.jpg"></center>
            <p>Neutral colors often serve as the backdrop in design. They’re commonly combined with brighter accent colors. But they can also be used on their own in designs, and can create very sophisticated layouts. The meanings and impressions of neutral colors are much more affected by the colors that surround them than are warm and cool colors.</p>
